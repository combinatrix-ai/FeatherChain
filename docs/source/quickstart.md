# Quickstart

PromptTrail is a lightweight library to help you build something with LLM.
PromptTrail aims to provide:

- **Unified LLM Interface**: a unified interface to access various LLM models (`promttrail.modelss`)
- **Agent as Code**: simple and intuitive DSL to build agent (conversation flow) with code (`promttrail.agents`)
- **Developer Tools for LLM**: various tools enable mocking, logging, debugging (`promttrail.core`)
